# 👋 Welcome to Refacto

**Refacto** is a software engineering team focused on building **clean, scalable, and data-driven platforms** for real-world problem solving.

We believe in **refactoring not just code, but systems and workflows** — transforming complex requirements into maintainable, well-structured software.

---

## 🚀 What We Build

We build **project evaluation platforms** that help organizations assess, score, and analyze projects in a structured and data-driven way.

Our work typically involves:
- Project and proposal evaluation
- Scoring and assessment workflows
- Risk and feasibility analysis
- Insight and recommendation generation
- Practical applications of machine learning

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

We use modern, industry-aligned tools and practices:

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** NestJS, REST APIs, JWT-based authentication
- **Machine Learning:** Python, classical ML models, NLP techniques
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Docker Compose, CI/CD workflows

---

## 🗂 Repository Structure

Our repositories are organized by responsibility to keep systems modular and scalable:

- **frontend** – User interface and client-side logic  
- **backend** – Core API, authentication, and business logic  
- **ml-service** – Model training, prediction, and inference  
- **infra** – Deployment, containerization, and environment configuration  

This structure allows each part of the platform to evolve independently while remaining well-integrated.

## 🧪 Engineering Principles

At Refacto, we value:

- Clean architecture and separation of concerns  
- Meaningful tests that provide real value  
- Consistent conventions across repositories  
- Practical solutions over unnecessary complexity  
- Clear, useful documentation  

---

## 👥 Team

Refacto is a collaborative team of software engineering students working on **long-term, production-minded projects**.

We approach our work as real software engineering — not just academic output.

---

## 📌 Project Status

- 🛠 Actively developed  
- 🔁 Iterative improvements per sprint  
- 🧹 Continuous refactoring and technical debt management  

---

## 🤝 Contributions

This organization is primarily for internal development, but we welcome:
- Constructive discussions
- Thoughtful reviews
- Improvements that enhance clarity and maintainability
